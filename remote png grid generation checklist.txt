Great â€” now that you're ready, hereâ€™s your checklist to test the full remote grid generation flow:

---

## âœ… Deployment Checklist

1. **Confirm `generate_png_grid.py` is deployed**
   - Located in your backend repo
   - Uses `lowresfacsimiles/` and `static/previews/`
   - Callable via `generate_png_grid(handle, wall_w, wall_h)`

2. **Ensure `lowresfacsimiles/` is present**
   - Contains folders matching each mural handle
   - Each folder has `Page_001.tif`, `Page_002.tif`, etc.

3. **Confirm `static/previews/` is served publicly**
   - Flaskâ€™s `static_folder="static"` is active
   - PNGs saved to `static/previews/` are reachable via URL

4. **Deploy updated `app.py`**
   - Includes `/api/accurate-grid` route
   - Calls `generate_png_grid()` and returns `grid_url`

## ðŸ§ª Test It

Send a POST request to:

```
https://mural-api.onrender.com/api/accurate-grid
```

With JSON body:

```json
{
  "handle": "Dickens, Charles, Four Stories, Captain Boldheart...",
  "wall_width": 100,
  "wall_height": 100
}
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "grid_url": "https://mural-api.onrender.com/static/previews/dickens-charles-four-stories-captain-boldheart_grid.png"
}
```

Open that URL in your browser â€” it should show the accurate grid PNG rendered from the `.tif` files.
